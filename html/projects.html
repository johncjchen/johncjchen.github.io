					<h1>Faraday Bike Light</h1>

					<p>A current interest of mine is creating a bike light that does not seriously impede the rider when generating power. To this end, I definitely did not want to do a dynamo or hub generator powered bike light. As a result, I went with the concept of an inductor-powered bike light. </p>
					<p>The concept behind this "Faraday" bike light is a (neodymium?) magnet attached to the spokes of the wheel which then passes by the inductor coil, inducing a voltage.</p>
					<p>The picture to the left shows the enclosure for the inductor coil. There is space within the coil for a magnet to rotate freely and thus add to the changing magnetic field.</p>

					<h1>Wire Station</h1>

					<p>This was a quick project I did because of my issues with wire management next to my bed and desk. This wire docking station was specifically built for my bed frame which is to the right of my desk. That is also the general area where I like to charge my electronic devices.</p>

					<p>Design Goals and Specifics</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Modular -> connectable in pieces like a puzzle</li>
						<li>Simple yet sturdy -> hook design and gusset</li>
						<li>Extensive capacity -> spacing for wire goes from large to small to accomodate wires of all types</li>
						<li>3D-printable -> try to limit overhangs and keep design as simple as possible</li>
					</ul>
					<p>On the 3D printing note, the modular pieces are intended to be printed on the flat side with the gusset, but I did encounter an predicament between modularity and 3D-printer satisfaction. However, I placed higher importance on the modularity aspect, especially with how advanced 3D printers have become. Overhangs are hardly an issue anymore.</p>
