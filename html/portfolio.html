				<div class="project-description">
      <p>As an intern/co-op at Karl Storz Imaging, my main project was the intergration and testing of an automated reprocessing system which could test company products in a simulated hospital cleaning environment.</p>
      <p>To clean reusable medical instruments, hospitals subject these products to a combination of three methods: cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization. Cleaning and disinfection are similar methods, utilizing an acid or base solution to rid instruments of harmful bacteria. Sterilization works via an autoclave, a steam chamber of high temperature and pressure.</p>
      <p>My main tasks included the electrical integration and mechanical fixes to the subsystems. I then had to program the software on Python and Arduino C++ to run on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino MEGA such that the system could run a variety of cleaning combinations and input parameters. Parameters included temperature, chemical concentration, and time among others.</p>
      <p>The last step of the project was the design of experiment (DOE) phase, during which I created a central composite design to study the effects of each chamber's parameters on the output (degradation of surface coatings).</p>
      <p>Links to the two capstone projects I integrated: <a href = "https://capstone.engineering.ucsb.edu/projects/accel">Accel</a> and <a href = "https://capstone.engineering.ucsb.edu/projects/kronoscope">Kronoscope</a></p>

          <p>Taken from my team's <a href = "https://capstone.engineering.ucsb.edu/projects/contratech">UCSB project page</a>:</p>
          <p>Our project aims to redefine how you realign your spine. Traditional Transforaminal Lumbar
             Interbody Fusion procedures involve cutting open the patient's back to access the spine,
             resulting in long surgeries and recovery times of up to 6 weeks. In the minimally invasive form of
             this surgery, the patient's back only needs a small 20mm incision, allowing patients to go home
             the same day! However, current tools are unable to reach and clear the far side of the disc
             through this small incision, leading to increased surgical times and risk as well as inadequate
             preparation for spinal cage insertion.</p>
             <p>To address this problem, our tool is designed to articulate and completely remove disc material.
             The tool features a thin, robust linkage mechanism with a ringed curette tool tip to break up
             material. The surgeon controls a dial on the handle to articulate and clear the disc space,
             allowing for faster, more thorough procedures and quicker recoveries!</p>

				<div class="project-description">
          <p>As a quarter-long project, we utilized the primary mechanism of vine robots (eversion) to extend and retract the saber into the hilt. The lightsaber is composed of two main components: the saber bag and the pressurized handle.</p>
          <p>The handle contains the electronics (i.e. battery, buttons, control board, and motor+spool) and is pressurized with air in order for the saber to expand. The saber itself is a two-layer bag composed of Dyneema on the outside for holding its geometry and TPU for an airtight seal.</p>
          <p>A string is attached internally to the tip of the saber bag and conencted to the spool in the handle, wherein there is a clutch mechanism to allow for the sudden release of the spool to emulate a lightsaber's rapid extension.</p>
