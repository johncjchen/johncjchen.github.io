							<h2>Hello, Welcome to my website!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My name is Minh Bui, as of 2025, I'm a first year Masters student, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. My degree objective is a thesis with emphasis on Computer Architecture &amp; Systems, and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). My defense will be hosted some time in June 2026, stay tuned!</p>
            <p>Advised by prof. Balkind at ArchLab, my current research interests are multicore architectures, hardware acceleration, and interconnect topology. Outside of my primary research, I am also interested in semiconductor physics, process technology, and reliability in hardware.</p>   

            <p>Some personal bio: I was orginally born in Hồ Chí Minh city, Việt Nam. I moved to California when I was 16. My English is not perfect, but I've gotten much better with time. Recently, my hobbies have been pottery (see my photo gallery), electric guitar (my favorite band is Pink Floyd), ping pong, and going to all sorts of cafes in Austin, TX. Some more fun facts: I'm a big fan of watching movies &amp; cartoons, I've been learning Japanese for a few months (about A2 level).</p>

            <p>Long Term Goals: I want to leave a positive impact on the open-source community, which I'm hoping to achieve through my Master's thesis and my PhD work in the future, that is, before I sell my soul to the silicon design corporate monarchy. I want to travel the world, I have to fund such trips myself, and I'm broke, so that's a far future thing.</p> 

            <p>The documentation website (so far) for my Masters project is <a href="https://plastic-track-db1.notion.site/1d0e806fae7a80949be6fbc5375e0b4f?v=1d0e806fae7a816488f7000c6d955377">here</a>, and from time to time I write small blogs/rants, which can be viewed <a href="https://cake-penguin-90f.notion.site/Some-tidbits-of-blogging-1fb1db89705880528f42ea0fa4269d3c">here</a> </p>

The core is also fully built and tested in Cadence Virtuoso using the NCSU 45nm PDK. The clock speed is tested to be ~600Mhz based on the capacitive modelling at the time of the project.  <br>

              A paper I wrote for the Computer Arithmetic course, where I explored the differences between using CMOS, CPL, CPL-TG for building low-power high-performance adders. Experiments were carried out in Synopsys HSPICE using the IBM130NM 8RF PDK, and gates were sized manually to ensure optimal VTC characteristics.
